  This AOS creates a compressed archive of the a directory. 

  It utilizes the tar utility with the following options: 
  -c for creating a new archive, 
  -z for compressing the archive using gzip, 
  -v for verbose output to display the progress of the archiving process, 
  and -f to specify the filename of the archive (example.tgz). 
  As a result, the assets directory and its contents are bundled 
  into a single file named example.tgz, which is both space-efficient
  and easy to transport.

command:
  exec: tar
