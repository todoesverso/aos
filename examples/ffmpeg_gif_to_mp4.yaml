  This AOS converts a GIF file into a MP4 using ffmpeg.

  The provided FFmpeg command processes a GIF image into
  an MP4 video format. It employs the -i flag to specify
  the input file, input.gif.gif, and outputs the processed
  video as output.mp4. 
  The -movflags faststart option optimizes the MP4 container
  for progressive playback by relocating essential metadata. 
  The -pix_fmt yuv420p flag mandates a YUV420p pixel format
  for the output video, a widely supported format known for
  its balance of color information and compression efficiency.
  Lastly, the -vf scale=trunc(iw/2)*2:trunc(ih/2)*2 filter
  rescales the input image to the nearest even dimensions by
  truncating the width and height to multiples of two,
  potentially improving compatibility with certain video
  codecs and hardware.

  exec: ffmpeg

      This option is used to optimize the MP4 file for web streaming. 
      It moves the metadata to the beginning of the file, allowing the 
      video to start playing before it is fully downloaded
  - option: -pix_fmt
    value: yuv420p
    description: > 
      This sets the pixel format of the output video. 
      yuv420p is a widely compatible pixel format that ensures the 
      video can be played on most devices and platforms.
  - option: -vf
    value: "scale=trunc(iw/2)*2:trunc(ih/2)*2" 
    description: >
      This applies a video filter (-vf) to scale the video. 
      The scale filter is used to resize the video dimensions. 
      The expression trunc(iw/2)*2 ensures that the width (iw) is an even number, 
      and trunc(ih/2)*2 does the same for the height (ih). 
      This is important because some video codecs require even dimensions
