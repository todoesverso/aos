  This AOS creates a symbolic link to a file or directory using the `ln` command.

  The provided `ln` command creates a symlink, which is a reference to another file or directory. 
  The `-s` flag specifies that the link should be symbolic (as opposed to a hard link).
  The first argument is the target file or directory, and the second argument is the name of the symlink to be created.

  This AOS has a different order in the position arguments than the final command executed.

  $ aos create_a_symlink.yaml <symlink_name> <target>

  This is because in my head the final command should be:
  $ create_a_symlink this -> to_this

command:
  exec: ln

      A symbolic link is a special type of file that serves as a reference 
      to another file or directory in the filesystem.
